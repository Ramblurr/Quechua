# Classification of Suffixes in Quechua

There are many suffixes in Quechua that can be stacked on a root word to change
or add meaning.

*Note:* The names for the suffixes are translations from Spanish names, and
I am not 100% confident in the original Spanish names, let alone my
translations. I'm not a linguist, so beware. Thankfully, the names of the
suffixes aren't necessary to learning how to use them.

If you spot an innacuracies in the descriptions of these suffixes, please shoot
me an email (see very bottom).

### **-LLA**: Limitative 
This suffix has two usaages:

1. Expresses a limitation in what is being said. Can appear on any element in
   the sentence (subject, object, verb). Corresponds to the connotations: only,
   exclusively, uniquely.

<div class="example">
<p>Kinsa<strong>lla</strong>n wawaykunaqa <br />
<em>They have only three children</em></p>
<p>T'anta<strong>lla</strong>ta sapa p'unchay mikhuyku <br />
<em>We eat only bread every day</em></p>
<p>Pisi<strong>lla</strong>n Punomanta hamushanku <br />
<em>Only a few are coming from Puno. </em></p>
</div>

2. Used in polite situations to express courtesy, friendship, and affection.

<div class="example">
<p>Imayna<strong>lla</strong> kashanki <br />
How are you?</p>
<p>Alli<strong>lla</strong>nmi kashani <br />
I am doing good</p>
<p>Qhali<strong>lla</strong>chu Maria kashan <br/>
Is Maria healthy?<p>
<p>Ari, qhali<strong>lla</strong>nmi kashan <br />
Yes, she is healthy</p>
</div>

<a id="min"></a>
### **-MI/-N**: Evidential, Personal Knowledge
Used to assert or confirm what was said by the speaker; indicates the speaker has personal experience with the claim. Can be added to any element of the sentence. Is not translatable.

**-mi**: is used for words that end in a consonant (allillan**mi**, good)  
**-n**: is used for words that end in a vowel (wasi**n**, house)

<div class="example">
<p>parashan <br />
It is raining. (source of information unknown)</p>
<p>parashan<strong>mi</strong> <br />
It is raining. (speaker knows it is raining through direct experience)
<p>parashan
</div>

<a id="chu"></a>
### **-CHU**: Interrogative
Used in sentences that do not have a question word (e.g., Imay, what).
Indicates that the speaker is asking a question. The word to which it is
attached is what the speaker is asking about or is interested in.

<div class="example">
<p>Allillan<strong>chu</strong> kashankichis? <br />
Are you all doing well?</p>
<p>Qhalillan<strong>chu</strong> Maria kashan <br />
Is Maria healthy?</p>
<p>Runasimita<strong>chu</strong> rimanki <br />
You speak Quechua? (emphasis on the Quechua)</p>
<p> Runasimita rimanki<strong>chu</strong> <br />
You speak Quechua? (emphasis on the speaking)</p>
</div>

<a id="ri"></a>
### -RÍ: Inchoative
Added to the end of words and functions as an interrogative or prompts the
conversation to continue. It is translated like "and." When used rí is
emphasized, instead of the second to last syllable.

<div class="example">
<p>Allillanmi kashayku. Qan<strong>rí</strong>? <br />
We are good. And you?</p>
</div>

Need more non-name/pronoun examples.

<a id="pas"></a>
### -PAS/-PIS: Inclusive
Used in sentences of affirmation and corresponds to the translation "also" or "likewise".

<div class="example">
<p>Maria<strong>pas</strong> allillanmi kashan. <br />
Maria also is doing well.</p>
<p>Wiraqucha<strong>pis</strong> runasimita riman <br />
Likewise the señor speaks Quechua.</p>
</div>

<a id="kama"></a>
### -KAMA: Terminative
Indicates a limit in space or time and also conveys the goal of an action.
Corresponds to the translation "until".
<div class="example">

Until tomorrow Señora Gabina.</p>
<p>Minchha<strong>kama</strong>chu rishanki. <br />
Are you going until tomorrow?</p>
<p>Arí, minchha<strong>kama</strong> rishani. <br />

</div>

### -Y: Vocative

and the person or thing being addressed. Can be accompanied by the suffixes
*-chay* and *-lla*.

<em>I am already speaking Quechua</em> </p>
<p>Qhali<strong>ña</strong>chu kashanki <br/>
<em>You're already healthy?</em></p>
</div>

<a id="pi"></a>
### -PI: Locative (also ablative)
One of the several ablative case markers. 
Indicates a specific location in geographical space or place. Corresponds
vaguely to the prepositions "in" and "at".

<div class="example">
<p>May<strong>pi</strong>n tiyashanki <br />
<em>(In) where do you live? </em> </p>
<p>Paykunan Qusqu<strong>pi</strong> runasimita yachashanku <br />

</div>

<a id="manta"></a>
### -MANTA: Ablative
One of the several ablative case markers. Primary usage indicates the place of
origin. Is a distinct suffix and is not composed of the individual suffixes
*-man* and *-ta*.

<div class="example">
<p>Nuqa Qusqu<strong>manta</strong>n kani <br />
<em>I am from Cuzco</em> </p>
<p>Nuqayku karu llaqta<strong>manta</strong>n hamushayku <br />
<em>We (restrictive) are coming from a far village </em></p>
</div>

<a id="qa"></a>
### -QA: Topic Marker
Marks a previously established topic in discourse. *-qa* may be suffixed on
nouns, pronouns, adjectives, nominalized clauses, etc.
However, *-qa* does not occur on negative lexemes (mana and ama), the
conjunctions, y 'and' and o 'or' borrowed from Spanish, or within subordinate
clauses.  One *-qa* may occur per sentence. ([source][stan])

Generally occurs in affirmative sentences.

<div class="example">
<p>Wawaykikuna runasimita rimashallankuchu <br />
<em>You're children are only speaking Quechua?</em> <br />
Ari, wawaykuna<strong>qa</strong> runasimita rimashallanku <br />
<em>Yes, my children[-topic] are only speaking Quechua</em> </p>
<p>Nuqapis munani iñiyta<strong>qa</strong> <br />
<em>I also want to believe[-topic]</em></p>
</div>

<a id="kuna"></a>
### -KUNA: Plural marker
Marks nouns, pronouns in the 2nd and 3rd person, and demonstrative pronouns as
plural. If the meaning is clear, then *-kuna* is optional. For example, if the
sentence contains a number, then *-kuna* can be omitted.

<div class="example">
<p>wasi &rarr; wasi<strong>kuna</strong> <br />
<em>house &rarr; houses </em></p>
<p>Qan &rarr; Qan<strong>kuna</strong> <br />
<em>You &rarr; You (all) </em> </p>
<p>Iskayllan ususiy kani<br />
<em>I have only two daughters</em></p>
</div>

<a id="qpa"></a>
### -Q/PA: Genitive
Appears on nouns and indicates possession or ownership.

When a word ends in a vowel use *-q* or occasionally *-qpa*. When a word ends
in a consonant use *-pa*.

When the possessor and thing possessed appear in a sentence, the possessor takes
the genitive *-q/pa* and the thing possessed takes the possessive suffix.

<div class="example">
<p>Qusay<strong>pa</strong> pana<u>n</u> <br />
<em>The sister of my husband</em></p>
<p>Irqi<strong>q</strong> pukllana<u>n</u> <br />
<em>The boy's toy</em></p>
<p>Qan<strong>pa</strong> llaqta<u>yki</u> hatunchu<br />
<em>Is your village big?</em></p>
</div>

<a id="wan"></a>
### -WAN: Instrumental

Appears on nouns, pronouns, and adjectives. Signals accompaniment or the means
or instrument, animate or inanimate, that someone uses to do something. In this
case *-wan* is translated as "with".

Also can be used as a conjunction to indicate something additional, join words or phrases, or join sentences, in which case it is translated as "and".

*Note*: It is possible for both meanings to be used ("with" and conjunction),
see the final example.

<div class="example">
<p>Qusaypa panan<strong>wan</strong>mi qhipakuni <br />
<em>I stay with the sister of my husband</em></p>
<p>Puka<strong>wan</strong> yurqaqmi bandiranchis <br />
<em>Our flag is red and white</em></p>
<p>Pidru<strong>wan</strong>, Pablu<strong>wan</strong>, nuqami runasimita
yachashayku <br />
<em>Pedro, Pablo, and I are studying Quechua</em></p>
<p>Churiy<strong>wan<u>wan</u></strong> riranchis <br />
<em>We went with my son (we and my son)</em></p>
</div>
