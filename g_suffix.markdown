# Suffixes in Quechua

There are many suffixes in Quechua that can be stacked on a root word to change
or add meaning.

### **-LLA**: Limitative
Used in polite situations to express courtesy, friendship, and affection.


<div class="example">
<p>Imayna<strong>lla</strong> kashanki <br />
How are you?</p>
<p>Alli<strong>lla</strong>nmi kashani <br />
I am doing good</p>
<p>Qhali<strong>lla</strong>chu Maria kashan <br/>
Is Maria healthy?<p>
<p>Ari, qhali<strong>lla</strong>nmi kashan <br />
Yes, she is healthy</p>
</div>

### **-MI/-N**: Evidential, Personal Knowledge
Used to assert or confirm what was said by the speaker; indicates the speaker has personal experience with the claim. Can be added to any element of the sentence. Is not translatable.

**-mi**: is used for words that end in a consonant (allillan**mi**, good)  
**-n**: is used for words that end in a vowel (wasi**n**, house)

<div class="example">
<p>parashan <br />
It is raining. (source of information unknown)</p>
<p>parashan<strong>mi</strong> <br />
It is raining. (speaker knows it is raining through direct experience)
<p>parashan
</div>

### **-CHU**: Interrogative
Used in sentences that do not have a question word (e.g., Imay, what).

attached is what the speaker is asking about or is interested in.

<div class="example">

<p>Qhalillan<strong>chu</strong> Maria kashan <br />
