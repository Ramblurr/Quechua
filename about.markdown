# About

### On Dialects

The pronunciation, grammar, vocabulary, and spelling varies between different
Quechua dialects. I studied the Cuzco dialect, and hence that is what is used
throughout this website.

### Remarks About Spelling

On this site I do my best to adhere to the official (in Peru) three-vowel
alphabet. However, I've learned from multiple teachers, some who used the older
five-vowel alphabet and other who use the modern three-vowel, so occasionally, you might find aberrant spellings.

If you're not familiar with The Great Vowel Debate, I recommend the following
articles on the topic:

* [Quechua Pronunciation and Spelling][spelpron]
* [The Great Unholy Row:  Three Vowel Letters or Five?][archcam]

I've done my best to make sure everything on this site is accurate and useful;
however, if you see any mistakes or have any suggestions, please feel free to
let me know.
