title: Quechua Language Notes
---

Here you can find information about the Quechua language. These pages are edited compilations from my Quechua notebooks. I'm still in the process of learning Quechua myself, so this site will be updated as I continue to learn.

Important Disclaimer: Unlike other online Quechua resources, that were presumably compiled by a native speaker or linguist, this website is edited by a non-native from notes, and hence *should not be considered a reliable source regarding the Quechua language*; however, since what is here is what I, myself, know about Quechua, I hope it is correct. The same goes for any Spanish you find on this website.

* The [vocabulary lists][vocab] useful lists of vocab words. When possible I include a sample sentence. Translations in English and Spanish.
* The [grammar notes][grammar] provide information on various topics such as pronouns, verb conjugations and tenses, and more, with examples to show usage.
* The [about page][about] contains remarks about the alphabet used on this site.
* The [links][links] go to free websites with useful resources for Quechua language learning.

Looking for something in particular?  Use the Google search box to search this website.  Tip: if you're searching for a vocabulary word and can't find the word you're looking for, use the infinitive; ex. "to cooperate" instead of "cooperation."
