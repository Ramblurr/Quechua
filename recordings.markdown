# Quechua Audio Recordings

There is a severe scarcity of high-quality, native-spoken Quechua recordings
available on the Internet. Since Quechua is fundamentally a verbal language,
audio recordings are invaluable to the Quechua student.

During my time in Peru, my goal is to record as much real Quechua as I can.
This includes everything from phrases and dialogs, to stories or books.

While I strive for the highest quality recordings, I lack high-quality
recording equipment and the surrounding environments are often noisy, though
I do my best to preserve the original sound and pronunciation while minimizing
the background noise.
