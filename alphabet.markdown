# Quechua Alphabet


*(Note: For remarks regarding the three vs five vowel debate, please see the
[about][about] page.)*

The Quechua alphabet consists of 3 vowels, 2 semi-consonants, and 25
consonants.

Three vowels: **a, i, u**  
Two semi-consonants: **w, y**  
Twenty-five consonants: 

| | | | | | | |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:
| **ch** | **chh** | **ch'** | **f**  | **h**  
| **k**  | **kh**  | **k'**  | **l**  | **ll** | **m**
| **n**  | **ñ**   | **p**   | **ph** | **p'** | **q**
| **qh** | **q'**  | **r**   | **s**  | **sh** | **t**
| **th** | **t'**

Borrowed letters (used only in loan words): **b**, **d**, **rr**, **g**

## Pronunciation

This isn't a comprehensive pronunciation guide. I've tried to cover most of the
sounds in Quechua, but there are likely a few that have escaped my attention.

Below is the entire Quechua alphabet with an example word in English and
Spanish that highlights the pronunciation of the Quechua letter. For some letters, it is very helpful to be familiar with the pronunciation of Spanish letters.

The pronunciation, grammar, vocabulary, and spelling varies between different
Quechua dialects. I learned the Cuzco dialect, and hence that is what is used
throughout this website.

#### vowels
* **a**: like the **a** in f**a**ther
* **i**: like the **ee** in b**ee**, but shorter; occasionally like the **e** in
  b**e**t
* **u**: like the **oo** in b**oo**t, occasionally like **o** in b**o**ne

#### semi- consonants
* **w**: like the **w** in **w**atch
* **y**: depends on the preceding vowel, see below

#### consonants

* **chh**: aspirated ch, see below
* **ch'**: glottalized ch, see below
* **f**: **f**ace
* **h**: **h**appy
* **k**: **c**at
* **kh**: aspirated k, see below

* **t**: **t**ip

#### aspirated consonants

Aspirated, or vocalized, consonants have an extra buff of breath after the
consonant sound. We have this in English, however, we do not have a separate
letter for it, because it is not necessary to distinguish between words with
different meanings.

Say **pit** out loud and hold your hand about six inches in front of your mouth.
You'll feel the puff of breath that accompanies the **p** of **pit**, because it's automatically aspirated in English.

With your hand still about six inches in front of your mouth, now say **spit**
out loud. Notice that there's no puff of breath this time, since P is not
aspirated in English when there's an **s**  in front of it.

Quechua examples:

* **chh**: the **ch+h** in wat**ch here**
* **kh**: the **k+h** in ta**ke h**home
* **ph**: the **p+h** in u**ph**ill, said forcefully
* **th**: the **t+h** in Whi**te H**ouse
* **qh**: unfortunately, there is no good example for this one in English.

#### glottalized consonants

The **'** character denotes a glottal stop, which is a distinctive short
popping or explosion sound.

To pronounce a glottalized consonant, close off your air as if you're lifting something heavy, pronounce the consonant sound, then continue breathing out.

A sequence of consonant plus glottal stop is pronounced as a single unit. The glottal stop starts at the same time as you begin the consonant, and then you release both together.

Glottalization makes a difference in the meaning of words. Glottalization may
be the only thing that's different between words that are otherwise identical.

Also, they're fun to pronounce.

#### aspirated and glottalized consonant examples

| Simple | Aspirated | Glottalized
|:----:|:-----------:|:----------:|
| chay | chhayna     | ch'aki
| kay  | khipu       | k'aspi
| qan  | qhapaq      | q'iwi
| pay  | phiwi       | p'acha
| tayta| thuta       | t'anta

#### semi-consonant vowel pairs

The semi-consonants precede be a vowel have unique sounds:

* **ay**: **eye**
* **aw**: **ou**t
* **iy**: **ea**t or **ei**ght
* **uy**: **oi**nk or **whea**t or p**ooey**

#### the q-rule

In Quechua, there is a special pronunciation rule for a **q** followed by
a **u** or **i**.

* **qu**: like **co**ke (but deeper in the throat), *NOT* like **coo**l.  
     sometimes written as **qo** (though this is incorrect)
* **qi**: like **Que**chua (but deeper in the throat), *NOT* like **key**   
     sometimes written as **qe** (though this is incorrect)

Corollary of the q-rule:

* Often **uq** sounds like **oq** (co**ke**)
* Often **iq** sounds like **eq** (Queb**ec**)
